        <h2>Biography!</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Hello there, my name is Paola and I'm an aspiring web developer at RVCC.
            My interest for web development started with a web design class that I took
            in my freshman year of high school. This web design class introduced to me 
            the basic concepts of HTML and CSS, along with some of the elements of
            multimedia, such as text, image, and animation. My teacher made the lessons 
            that we did each week interesting to learn about and we were able to incorporate
            the topics that we learned into our assignments that we were assigned. I still 
            remember how for our midterm and final exam, we had to do a practicum of mimicking a 
            sample web page and being able to create our own web page from a topic of our choice. 
            I always had fun doing the assignments that my teacher assigned to us, since they 
            were always easy and straighforward to do, along with how they let us express our 
            creativity too. Our boundary of sticking to the minimum was never there, so my teacher
            let us to be free with what we would do, as long as it was school appropriate of course. </p>
            <p>Before I made a choice of pursuing a major in web development, my initial thought
            was to major in computer science, but even though I knew about the dilemma with how there
            isn't enough women in the computer science field, I also passed that assumption along to how
            there isn't enough women in web development either. The strive to change the current statistics 
            of another demanding tech field is something that I wish to establish for myself and for other women
            as well.</p>

        <h2>Excerpt from Dracula</h2>
            <div>
                <p>As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack.
                My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, 
                by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more fixed in my manner, 
                if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing. 
                I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat; 
                and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition. 
                He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--</p>
                <p>"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will; send keepers with me with whips and chains; 
                let them take me in a strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. 
                I am speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't know whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell. 
                By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt! 
                Can't you hear me, man? Can't you understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul?
                Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!"</p>
                <p>I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.</p>
                <p>"Come," I said sternly, "no more of this; we have had quite enough already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly."</p>
                <p>He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the bed. 
                The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had expected.</p>
                <p>When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a quiet, well-bred voice:--</p>
