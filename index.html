        <h2>Biography!</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="/img/bio-image-200w.jpg" alt="A picture of myself">
            <p>Hello there, my name is Paola and I'm an aspiring web developer at RVCC.
            My interest for web development started with a web design class that I took
            in my freshman year of high school. This web design class introduced to me 
            the basic concepts of HTML and CSS, along with some of the elements of
            multimedia, such as text, image, and animation. My teacher made the lessons 
            that we did each week interesting to learn about and we were able to incorporate
            the topics that we learned into our assignments that we were assigned. I still 
            remember how for our midterm and final exam, we had to do a practicum of mimicking a 
            sample web page and being able to create our own web page from a topic of our choice. 
            I always had fun doing the assignments that my teacher assigned to us, since they 
            were always easy and straighforward to do, along with how they let us express our 
            creativity too. Our boundary of sticking to the minimum was never there, so my teacher
            let us to be free with what we would do, as long as it was school appropriate of course. </p>
            <p>Before I made a choice of pursuing a major in web development, my initial thought
            was to major in computer science, but even though I knew about the dilemma with how there
            isn't enough women in the computer science field, I also passed that assumption along to how
            there isn't enough women in web development either. The strive to change the current statistics 
            of another demanding tech field is something that I wish to establish for myself and for other women
            as well.</p>

        <h2>CSS Image Hover Effects</h2>
            <div>
                <p>When it comes to image hover effects, they add visual effects to an image. It also brings interactivity to the user in seeingwhat kind of effects there could be.
                This interactivity influences how a user is able to be engaged in a browser and encourages their focus to explore what the browser has to offer. At the same time, it lets the user
                have some kind of fun experience with playing around with an image hover effect an image might have on the browser too, There are numerous ways images in general can have effects to them, ranging from zooming in and outwards, having
                a blurry effect to it, and much more. For this blog, I will talk about some of the basic image hover effects that are standard in websites. These mage hover effects come
                in different ways to incorporate them into websites. An image can have a hover effect that fades in with text, fades in with a box of text, slides from the top, bottom,
                left, and right, and zooms in at fullscreen. What I will be showing to do for an image hover effect will be </p>
