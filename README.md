## Description
With this project being an _About Me_ website, I have learned many skills about each part of the website. It has ranged from: 
 - Learning about Good Design Principles in Web Design
 - Learning about flex and grid
 - Being aware about color accesibility 
 - Being capable of styling elements properly with CSS 
 ` Using basic HTML to create sections of a website
 In the following, I go more into detail in what I've learned in each section of my website. 
## Navigation
**For the _navigation bar_ on top,** I learned how to do "vegetarian mode" at first. In "vegetarian mode", the navbar resembles that of regular navbars on other websites, where each link is next to each other sequentially. In different media states, the navbar would collapse and each link would stack upon one another. Then, when it came to making the navbar more interactive, "hamburger mode" was used instead for the mobile media state where the user can click and collapse the menu easily. 
## Introduction
**For the _introduction_,** I tweaked parts of it from my original with including a background image, a horizontal image of me, and what I had previously in my introduction, my name and where I live. 
## Biography
**With the _biography_,** I expanded upon my original biography to make a detailed version of why I wanted to pursue web development as a career instead of my previous choice, computer science. I also included another picture of me as well but it acts like a profile picture instead for how small it looks like. 
## Hobbies
**With the _hobbies_ section,** I've used lists to mention what some of my hobbies are, but what differentiates from my original hobbies section is how I included a picture of one of my hobbies and a mini description of it. 
## Gallery 
**The _photo galllery_** has been where I've used grid to be able to transform the gallery into columns in different media states. Being able to use grid so that it could make my website more interesting was something that I put more attention to than anything else. 
## Blog
**In my _blog section_,** I changed the topic of the blog from it being a sample Lorem Ipsum text from Dracula to it being about CSS image sprites. In the new blog topic, I go into depth of what image sprites are and what are their functions in general. 
## Video
**In my _video section_,** , I was able to make a short video through Windows Movie Maker and be able to embed it into my website through iFrame. The video is about pictures of cats followed one after the other, along with the audio being cats meowing. At the bottom of it, I also have a caption that gives a general idea of what the video is about too.  
## Contact Form 
**In my _contact form_ section,** making the contact form was a new experience for me when it came to making it from scratch essentially. For the input values of the form, they would be connected with Netlify in being there where any information that was submitted would end up being at. Highlighting and having messages visible to the user in letting them know what input works for each section of the form was also interesting to code as well. 
## Color Schemes in my Website
Throughout my website, I have incorporated many colors that prove to be accessible for those who experience color blindness for example. In particular, I've also looked into colors that are not too bright for a user to see. Bright colors have been difficult for me to see personally when I came across them on websites, so I don't want for users to experience that kind of difficulty either. 
My color scheme consists of these colors primarily: 
- #02006E rgb(2,0,110) (Navy Blue)
- #CF2B4F rgb(207,43,79) (Bright Light Red)
- #4547F5 rgb(69,71,245) (Bright Periwinkle)
- #348704 rgb(52,135,4) (Light Green)
- #2C8271 rgb(44,130,113) (Turquoise)
> Extra colors that I included as well are: 
- #000000 rgb(0,0,0)(Black)
- #1A4600 rgb(26,70,0) (Dark Green)
- #36A58F rgb(54,165,143) (Bright Light Turquoise)
- #46A9FA rgb(70,169,250) (Bright Sky Blue)
- #74A59B rgb(116,165,155) (Light Mint Green)
- #81CDFF rgb(129,205,255) (Light Blue)
- #8889FA rgb(136,137,250) (Light Lavender)
- #C74C98 rgb(199,76,152) (Light Bright Pink)
- #6495ED rgb(100,149,237) (Light Sky Blue)
- #FFFFFF rgb(255,255,255) (White)
