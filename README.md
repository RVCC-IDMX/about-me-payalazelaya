###### Description
With this project being an _ _About Me_ _ website, I have learned many skills about each part of the website. It has ranged from: 
 - Learning about Good Design Principles in Web Design
 - Learning about flex and grid
 - Being aware about color accesibility 
 - Being capable of styling elements properly with CSS 
 ` Using basic HTML to create sections of a website
 In the following, I go more into detail in what I've learned in each section of my website. 
##### Navigation
For the navigation bar on top, I learned how to do "vegetarian mode" at first. In "vegetarian mode", the navbar resembles that of regular navbars on other websites, where each link is next to each other sequentially. In different media states, the navbar would collapse and each link would stack upon one another. Then, when it came to making the navbar more interactive, "hamburger mode" was used instead for the mobile media state where the user can click and collapse the menu easily. 
##### Introduction
**For the _ _introduction_ _,** I tweaked parts of it from my original with including a background image, a horizontal image of me, and what I had previously in my introduction, my name and where I live. 
##### Biography
**With the _ _biography_ _,** I expanded upon my original biography to make a detailed version of why I wanted to pursue web development as a career instead of my previous choice, computer science. I also included another picture of me as well but it acts like a profile picture instead for how small it looks like. 
##### Hobbies
**With the _ _hobby_ _ section,** I have been able to use (insert). 
##### Gallery 
**The _ _photo galllery_ _** has been where I've used grid to be able to transform the gallery into columns in different media states. 
##### Blog
In my blog section,  
##### Video
**In my _ _video section_ _,** ,aking my video through Windows Movie Maker 
##### Contact Form 
**In my _ _contact form_ _ section,** making my contact form required 
##### Color Schemes in my Website
Throughout my website, I have incorporated many colors that prove to be accessible for those who experience color blindness for example. In particular, I've also looked into colors that are not too bright for a user to see. Bright colors have been difficult for me to see personally when I came across them on websites, so I don't want for users to experience that kind of difficulty either. 
My color scheme consists of these colors primarily: 
- #02006E (Navy Blue)
- #CF2B4F (Bright Light Red)
- #4547F5 (Bright Periwinkle)
- #348704 (Light Green)
- #2C8271 (Turquoise)
Extra colors that I included as well are 
- #000000 (Black)
- #1A4600 (Dark Green)
- #36A58F (Bright Light Turquoise)
- #46A9FA (Bright Sky Blue)
- #74A59B (Light Mint Green)
- #81CDFF (Light Blue)
- #8889FA (Light Lavender)
- #C74C98 (Light Bright Pink)
- #6495ED (Light Sky Blue)
